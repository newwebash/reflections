# Reflections - Lesson 2


## 1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* Converts working directory into a git repo.
* You need to do it to be able to run git commands on the directory.


## 2 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

| Staging area | Working directory | Repository |
| Contains log of changes that have been made but not committed | Part of repository, contains files | Holds all directories and subdirectories |


## 3 - What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It takes the commits from two different branches and combines them into one branch.
We represent it in the diagram to visualize the changes made in each branch and compare the changes.


## 4 - What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
