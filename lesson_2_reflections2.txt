# Reflections - Lesson 2


## 1 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

* Converts working directory into a git repo.
* You need to do it to be able to run git commands on the directory.


## 2 - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

| Staging area | Working directory | Repository |
| Contains log of changes that have been made but not committed | Part of repository, contains files | Holds all directories and subdirectories |
