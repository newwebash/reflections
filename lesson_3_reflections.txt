# Lesson 3 reflections

## 1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

## 2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case you're changing the code in one file and someone else is also modifying that same file. This prevents a sudden and unexpected edit from interfering with your task at hand.
