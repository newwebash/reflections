# Lesson 3 reflections

## 1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To enable collaboration with a team!


## 2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case you're changing the code in one file and someone else is also modifying that same file. This prevents a sudden and unexpected edit from interfering with your task at hand.


## 3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

| Fork | Clone | Branch |
------------------------
| A copy of a GitHub repository to a new repository | A copy of a git repository onto a local machine | A local copy of the repository where you can make changes and choose when to add them to the main repo |
